# **After disaster**

<audio src="File:\\\Cities and the pandemic.mp3"></audio>

**How much harm has the pandemic done to large Western cities?**

Until recently big cities were unstoppable. Year after year places like New York, London and Paris grew richer and busier. Since the turn of the century they have **shrugged off** **a dotcom crash**, a financial crisis, terrorist attacks and political **populism** caused partly by **resentment** at their prosperity and **arrogance**. Could their magical run possibly be coming to an end? 

**populism**:民粹主义
**shrug** something ↔ **off** : to treat something as unimportant and not worry about it 对……满不在乎
**the dotcom crash**: the period early in the year 2000 when share prices suddenly went down as hundreds of companies doing business on the internet failed or lost most of the value of their shares
**resentment**: a feeling of anger because something has happened that you think is unfair 愤恨，不满

There are reasons to worry. Covid-19 struck the most exciting, global cities hardest—the ones you find on the side of bags full of designer clothes. With 3% of America’s population, New York has suffered 19% of deaths attributed to the disease (see Briefing). One in four French deaths was in Paris and its region. Even as lockdowns lift, international travel restrictions and fear of infection will **linger**: London is only 15% as busy as normal. 

**linger**: to continue to exist

Such quietness poses **a grave threat** to cities, especially the big, global ones. Much of the joy of suburban life **derives** from the houses and gardens that are more affordable there. The pleasure of village life is the peace and the countryside. But cities **thrive on** their busy streets, restaurants and theatres, which are now quiet or closed. That is a loss for urban consumers, and a **calamity** for the many people, often immigrants, who sell services. 

**a grave threat**: a serious threat
**derive from:** to develop or come from something else 源自，源于
**thrive on**: to enjoy or be successful in a particular situation, especially one that other people find difficult or unpleasant
**calamity**: ```SYN``` disaster

The virus has attacked the core of what makes these cities **vibrant** and successful. They prosper not so much because of what they do for businesses, but because they **cram** together talented people who are **fizzing** with ideas. Americans in cities with more than 1m people are 50% more productive than those elsewhere. 

**vibrant**: full of activity or energy in a way that is exciting and attractive	 **```SYN``` lively**
**cram**: if a lot of people cram a place, they fill it
**fizz**: [液体]滋滋地冒泡

But crowding people in offices and bars now seems irresponsible. And, in contrast to when Spanish flu struck a century ago, many workers have alternatives. People are learning to **toil** from home; some have discovered that they like it. Facebook, until recently a **heroic** office-builder, has announced that it will let many employees keep working remotely even after **the virus is seen off**. **Commercial- and residential-property** markets could **slump** as jobs move out of cities, even if only for part of the week. **High-street** shops and cafés are likely to go under as they adjust to the cut in office workers, tourists and students. 

**toil**: to work very hard for a long period of time
**heroic**: extremely brave or determined, and admired by many people
**the virus is seen off**
**commercial**: related to business
**residential**: relating to homes rather than offices or business
**slump**: to suddenly go down in price, value, or number [价格、价值或数量]暴跌，骤降
**high-street**: the main street of a town, where most shops/stores, banks, etc. are

If they lose people, cities will run into a **fiscal crunch**, too. Their income from things like hotel taxes and bus fares has **evaporated**. New York’s independent budget office reports “absolute gloom and uncertainty” and **frets** that tax revenues may fall by $9bn in the next two fiscal years. The great danger is that cities **enter a spiral of budget cuts**, **deteriorating** services, rising crime and middle-class flight. It would be the 1970s all over again.

**fiscal**: relating to money, taxes, debts etc. that are owned and managed by the government
**crunch**: a difficult situation caused by a lack of something, especially money or time
**evaporate**: if a feeling evaporates, it slowly disappears
**fret**: to worry about something, especially when there is no need
**spiral**: a process, usually a harmful one, in which something gradually but continuously gets worse or better
**deteriorate**: to become worse

And yet cities are stronger and more **resilient** than they seem. **As with so much else, the fate of cities hangs on the development of treatments and vaccines**. But their magic cannot be **woven** **from afar** as easily as some suppose.

**resilient**: strong and not easily damaged by being pulled, pressed etc
**weave**: to move somewhere by turning and changing direction a lot
**from afar**: <font color=purple>*literary* </font>from a long distance away

Cities remain invaluable as places where people can build networks and learn how to **collaborate**. The brain-workers now logging into Zoom meetings from **commuter** towns and country cottages can do their jobs because they formed relationships and **imbibed** cultures in corporate offices. **Their heads are still in the city, though their feet are not.** Even a socially distanced, half-full office is essential for teaching new hires how a company works. If offices **facilitate** **chit-chat** and **gossip**, they are functioning well. Answering emails can be done from home.

**collaborate**: to work together with a person or group in order to achieve something, especially in science or art.
**commuter**: 通勤者
**imbibe**: to accept and be influenced by qualities, ideas, values etc
**facilitate**: to make it easier for a process or activity to happen 促进；使便利
**chit-chat**: conversation about things that are not very important
**gossip**: 流言蜚语

> The brain-workers: 主语
> logging into... country cottages: 伴随状语
> can do their jobs: 谓语宾语
> because: 连词

> formed, imbibed: 谓语
> relationships, cultures: 宾语
> in corporate offices: 状语

The hope is that, even if bankers and programmers stop coming into town, cities will adjust. Young people, who are at less risk from covid-19 and less worried about crime, could suddenly discover that life in the big smoke is affordable again. 

To encourage that, cities need to run themselves for the post-covid era. They are already **grappling** with how to move millions of people when nobody wants to **squeeze onto crowded buses and trains.** Some have bold plans for expanded networks of bike paths, and have **erected** plastic barriers to encourage walkers to occupy the roads. This is encouraging. But cities that fear commuters will **drop trains and buses for private cars**, **clogging** the roads, would do even better to manage demand by pricing driving and parking more highly. 

**grapple**: to try hard to deal with or understand something difficult
**erect**: to build sth such as a building or wall
**clog**: to block sth or become blocked

Cities also need more **autonomy**. New York’s **hapless mayor**, Bill de Blasio, has been a poor advertisement for muscular local government. But Seoul’s world-beating coronavirus response has been organised largely by the **metropolitan** government and by local officials. By contrast, the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, had to **lobby** the national government to insist on face masks on public transport. It agreed two months too late.

**autonomy**: 自治权
**hapless**: unlucky
**mayor**: 市长
**metropolitan**: 大城市的，大都会的
**lobby**：游说

**Bright lights**
National governments and states will need persuading that cities should have more power, especially as many will also be begging for money. They should step back anyway. Great cities are **obnoxious**, but they are normally big contributors to national budgets. And the trick they perform for their countries is not just economic. Cities are where people learn to live in a modern, open society. They are machines for creating citizens.

**obnoxious**: very offensive, unpleasant, or rude
